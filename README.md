# Node.js Server Not Responding to Requests

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js where a server fails to respond to incoming HTTP requests as expected. The provided `server.js` file contains a basic HTTP server that should respond with 'Hello, World!', but it might not function correctly due to a potential error in configuration or handling.

The `serverSolution.js` file offers a corrected version demonstrating proper implementation.  The bug is related to improper error handling or a potential issue with the event loop.
